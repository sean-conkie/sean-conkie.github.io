# About
sean-conkie, a seasoned data professional and Google certified Professional Cloud Architect.  I write about what interests me, mainly data engineering.  I'm not an expert but have experience in working with data in banking, insurance & pensions, credit risk and most recently telecommunications.  I enjoy learning anything new, but always fallback to Python...and who doesn't love a good spreasheet ðŸ˜‚

I am passionate about continuous improvement and supporting colleagues to grow and develop.

## Why create a blog?
In my current role I lead an agile chapter for Data Engineers focussing on data modelling and design.  In that role I started writing and sharing short blogs, one of them about setting up this blog on GitHub Pages.
